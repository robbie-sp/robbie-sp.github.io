                <h1>PyData London 2018</h1>
<p><img

    src="images/sponsors.jpg" alt="sponsors"></p>
<p>Around 700 attendees across three days. Talks covering new techniques and applications of machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), image classification, more traditional methods, graph theory and architecture of data science projects. This was my second PyData conference having previously attended the 2016 event.</p>
<p>If you look at one thing from the talk, pick one of these talks (details below):</p>
<ul>
<li>'Winning with Simple, even Linear, Models' - for ways to get a lot out of linear models</li>
<li>'Planes, Trains, and Skateboard Shoes - Bayesian methods in engineering and product design' - just a great talk and intro to Gaussian processes.</li>
<li>'Building out data science at QBE' - to see how the competition are doing it.</li>
<li>'Python Doesn’t Have to Be Slow: Speeding Up a Large-Scale Optimization Algorithm' - how to get the most out of Python for computationally heavy processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the talks and my chats with other attendees my takeaways are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond particular techniques there is still a compelling argument for actuarial teams to adopt many data science practices (use of code, how to measuring model accuracy, version control, notebooks).</li>
<li>Data science is still a young profession with attendees average age around 30 and many people coming from PhDs in the sciences. There is an energy and enthusiasm among the attendees that is quite infectious.</li>
<li>Wide range of industries and academia (tech, fashion, taxi apps, supermarkets, insurance (only QBE), banking, telecoms, Google) represented - everyone is investing in this.</li>
<li>Pace of innovation and development of open source data science is accelerating with new features added to existing tools and new tools being released all the time.</li>
<li>As a result, fragmented ecosystem tools is a challenge as there are so many options and pros and cons of each option are not clear. Still the pros of open source out-way the cons in my opinion.</li>
<li>Most people work within mixed teams of developers, IT, data science folk and end customers (e.g. marketers, traders, etc) rather than just with other data scientists which is very different to most actuarial teams in the insurance industry.</li>
<li>Most people use Slack in their work teams for messaging (replacing email and instant messaging), macs and Linux for computing and Git for version control. Most people code and present their results through Jupyter notebooks. They are comfortable with cloud tools such as Amazon AWS and Google Cloud and avoid proprietary software as much as possible.</li>
<li>Code is king - no-one is talking about GUIs for data science (although being PyData it is a biased sample). They may use code to build interfaces for exploring data or communicating with their clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>All talks should end up <a href="http://youtube.com/PyDataTV">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<h3>Computer Vision: An (Un?)Expected Journey, with Keras and Tensorflow</h3>
<p>Speaker: Rodolfo Bonnin (Machinalis)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rnditdev/PyData_London_2018_Computer_Vision">GitHub repository</a></p>
<p>Can also be run on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/rnditdev/PyData_London_2018_Computer_Vision/blob/master/1_History_of_neural_models.ipynb">Google CoLab</a></p>
<p><a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.</p>
<p>Keras seems to be a ML library with a straightforward syntax that incorporates many standard modelling techniques into the default fitting routines (e.g. validation).</p>
<p>Most of the neural net stuff was over my head but this talk introduced many concepts which will make it easier to get started if I start looking at image classification in more detail.</p>
<p>Use of Google CoLab was interesting.</p>
<h3>Apache Airflow in the Cloud: Programmatically orchestrating workloads with Python</h3>
<p>Speakers: Satyasheel, Kaxil Naik (Airflow contributor) both at <a href="https://www.datareply.co.uk/">Data Reply</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DataReplyUK/airflow-workshop-pydata-london-2018">GitHub repo</a></p>
<p>Failed to run on my machine due to a combination of Windows and Python 2 issues (Airflow was not working on Python 3 at the time, bug fixed by Sunday apparently). Airflow looks like the go to tool for managing tasks in complex calculations.</p>
<p>Looks like the goto tool for running workflows - potentially useful for ML and capital modelling.</p>
<h3>Network Science, Game of Thrones and US Airports</h3>
<p>Speaker: Mridul Seth</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MridulS/pydata-networkx">GitHub repo</a></p>
<p>Subject was very interesting and the examples helped with understanding the concepts.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis Testing with SciPy</h3>
<p>Speaker: Hillary Green-Lerman, head of data science at Codecademy.com</p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-scipy-hypothesis-testing/lessons/hypothesis-testing/exercises/types-of-hypothesis-test">Codecademy Course</a></p>
<p>A bit basic for actuaries I suspect.</p>
<h3>Winning with Simple, even Linear, Models</h3>
<p>Speaker: Vincent Warmerdam, koaning.io</p>
<p>http://koaning.io/theme/notebooks/bayes.pdf</p>
<p>Talk differed from the title. Covered a lot of topics but key takeaway was that linear models and feature engineering still have a lot of value compared to more complex ML techniques.</p>
